# Hi there! ðŸ˜Š 
## I'm Crashly, and I'm still a beginner when it comes to programming. 
- For now, I'm mostly working with Python and a few frameworks. But in the future, I'm excited to dive into website development and bot building. I've also started working with Arduino a little bit.
- I'm always looking for friendly and like-minded people to connect with, no matter where you're from. ðŸ˜Š
## ðŸ“© How can we get in touch?
